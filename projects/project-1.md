## Welcome:
"RatAttack" is a third person zombie shooter game. Players will have to maneuver through the city to get to the end objective without getting touched by a zombie. Each player will be able to choose one of three characters, all of which is able to walk, run, shoot and has HP. The three characters are kid, teen or adult, each with a special move stink bomb used to hurt a wide spread of zombies, distraction that distracts zombies, and power lungs that blasts the zombies away, respectively. In addition, the player will be able to use one of three guns in the beginning, which are able to shoot and reload. The three guns are pistol which is able shoot in close ranges, marksman rifle for single far shots, and automatic gun for automatic far shots. As the level progress ammo will randomly spawn on a map that the player can use with a gun.

This project was created to introduce us to Object Oriented Programming techniques. 

### OOP techniques implemented :  
    

 - Classes
 - Inheritance and composition
 - Character is a kid (inheritance)
 - Pistol is a gun (inheritance)
 - Kid has a gun	(composition)
 - Kid has a stink bomb (composition)
 - RAII: Constructors and destructors
 - Storing data: vectors, Queues, stacks, list, map
 - Abstract classes
 - Encapsulation (class gun, and character)
 - Getters and setters to get input from user
 - Interfaces
 - STD, iostreams
 - Random
 - lifecycle
 - Malloc, free, new
 - Overloading functions
 - Polymorphism to functions in classes
 - Class privacy
 - Templates
