## Welcome
Neural Networks, are computational algorithms or models designed as per the structure of the human brain.  
In the Perceptron notebook we learned how to build simple neural networks "one-neuron networks". Where for each neuron, we trained the neuron (ie set the weights) by minimizing a different kind of loss function for each model. We built each neuron with the help of keras, and gradient descent to learn the weight.
